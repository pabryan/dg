#+BEGIN_env defn
A sequence \((x_n)_{n\in \NN} \subseteq \RR^n\) /converges/ to \(x \in \RR^n\) if for every \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists a \(N \in \NN\) such that \((x_n)_{n \geq N} \subseteq B_{\epsilon} (x)\). We write \(\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = x\).
#+END_env

#+BEGIN_env defn
The sequence \((x_n)\) is /Cauchy/ if for every \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists a \(N \in \NN\) such that \((x_m)_{m \geq N} \subseteq B_{\epsilon} (x_n)\) for every \(n \geq N\).
#+END_env

- The condition for convergence to \(x\) says that \(\abs{x - x_n} < \epsilon\) for \(n \geq N\).
- The condition to be a Cauchy sequence says that \(\abs{x_n - x_m} < \epsilon\) for \(m, n \geq N\).

#+BEGIN_env defn :title "Sequential Continuity"
A function \(f : \RR^n \to \RR^m\) is continuous at \(x \in \RR^n\) if for /every/ sequence \((x_n)\) with \(\lim_{n \to \infty} = x\) we have \(\lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) = f(x)\).
#+END_env

#+BEGIN_env defn :title "\(epsilon\)-\(delta\) Continuity"
Write
\[
\lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) = y
\]
provided for every \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that \(f(B_{\delta} (x_0)) \subseteq B_{\epsilon} (y)\).

Then \(f\) is continuous at \(x_0\) if \(\lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) = f(x_0)\).
#+END_env

#+BEGIN_env defn :title "Topological Contitnuity"
The function \(f\) is continuous (at every \(x_0\)) if \(f^{-1} (V)\) is an open set for every open set \(V \subseteq \RR^m\).
#+END_env

- The first definition requires that \(f(x_n) \to f(x)\) for /every/ sequence.
- The condition in the second definition that \(f(B_{\delta} (x_0)) \subseteq B_{\epsilon} (y)\) is the same thing as \(\abs{f(x) - f(x_0)} < \epsilon\) whenever \(\abs{x - x_0} < \delta\).
- The second definition says that given /any tolerance \(\epsilon > 0\)/, there is an /adjustment \(\delta > 0\)/ so that provided we are sufficiently close to \(x_0\) (i.e. \(\abs{x - x_0} < \delta\)), then \(f(x)\) is within the desired tolerance of \(f(x_0)\) (i.e. \(\abs{f(x) - f(x_0)} < \epsilon\).
- The equivalence of the first and second definitions is a standard exercise in analysis using the /completeness/ of the real numbers \(\RR\).
- The final definition is the general /topological/ definition.
- The equivalence of the topological and \(\epsilon\)-\(\delta\) definitions follows by writing \(U = \cup_{y \in U} B_{r(y)} (y)\) as a union of open balls and using properties of the pull-back \(f^{-1}\).

#+BEGIN_env eg :title "Cautionary Example"
Let
\[
f(x, y) = \begin{cases}
\frac{x^2 y}{x^4 + y^2}, \quad (x, y) \ne (0, 0) \\
0, \quad (x, y) = (0, 0).
\end{cases}
\]

Then \(f\) is *not* continuous at \((x, y) = (0, 0)\).

Along every straight line through the origin \(y = ax\), the limit is in fact \(0\):
\[
\lim_{t \to 0} f(t, at) = \lim_{t\to 0} \frac{t^2 \cdot at}{t^4 + a^2t^2} = \lim_{t\to 0} \frac{t^2}{t^2} \frac{at}{t^2 + a^2} = 0.
\]

But along the curve \(y = x^2\), we get something else:
\[
\lim_{t \to 0} f(t, t^2) = \lim_{t\to 0} \frac{t^2 \cdot t^2}{t^4 + (t^2)^2} = \lim_{t\to 0} \frac{t^4}{t^4} \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
