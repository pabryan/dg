* Graphs of functions
** The graph of a function

#+BEGIN_env defn
Let \(f : U \subseteq_{\text{open}} \RR^2 \to \RR\) be smooth function
\[
\graph f := \{(u, v, f(u, v)) : (u, v) \in U\} \subseteq \RR^3.
\]
#+END_env

** Parametrisation

\[
F(u, v) = (u, v, f(u, v))
\]
is a /parmetrisation/ of \(\graph f\).

\(F\) gives a one to one identification of the points \((x, y, z) \in \graph f\) with the points \((u, v) \in U\) an open set of \(\RR^2\) on which we can do calculus!

** Paraboloid

#+BEGIN_env eg
Let \(f (u, v) = u^2 + v^2\)

\[
\graph(f) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)
\]
#+END_env

** Smooth functions on a graph

#+BEGIN_env defn
A function \(\eta : \graph f \to \RR\) is smooth if the function

\(\eta \circ F (x, y) = \eta(x, y, f(x, y))\) is smooth.

A function \(\eta = (\eta^1, \dots, \eta^m) : \graph f \to \RR^m\) is smooth if each \(\eta^i\) is.
#+END_env

** Ambient Smooth Functions

If \(\bar{\eta} : \RR^3 \to \RR\) is smooth then, by the chain rule \(\eta := \bar{\eta}|_{\graph f}\) is smooth since
\[
\eta \circ F = \bar{\eta}\lvert_{\graph f} \circ F = \bar{\eta} \circ F
\]
is the composition of smooth functions.

** Extension of smooth functions

#+BEGIN_env lem
Let \(\eta : \graph f \to \RR\) be a smooth function. Then /locally/ there exists a smooth function \(\bar{\eta} : \RR^3 \to \RR\) such that \(\eta = \bar{\eta}\lvert_{\graph f}\)
#+END_env

** Proof - Inclusions

In the special case that \(f \equiv 0\):

\(F(u, v) = (u, v, 0)\) is an inclusion.

By assumption \(\eta \circ F (u, v) = \eta(u, v, 0)\) is smooth.

Define \(\bar{\eta}(x, y, z) = \eta \circ \pi (x, y, z) = \eta(x, y, 0)\).

** Proof - General Case

\(F\) is an immersion: \(F = \psi^{-1} \circ \iota \circ \varphi\)

\(\psi(\graph(f)) = \lbrace z=0 \rbrace\)

\(\mu = \eta \circ \psi^{-1} \circ \iota = \eta \circ F \circ \varphi^{-1}\) is smooth on \(\lbrace z = 0 \rbrace\)

\(\bar{\eta} = \bar{\mu} \circ \psi\)

- Graphs are /global/ surfaces. They are diffeomorphic to an open set in the plane. 
- Many surfaces are not diffeomorphic to an open set in the plane! 
- The sphere, a torus, etc.

** Definition of Regular Surface

#+BEGIN_definition
A regular surface, \(S \subseteq \RR^3\) is subset of \(\RR^3\) such that there exists smooth /local parametrisations/ \(\varphi_{\alpha} : U_{\alpha} \subseteq \RR^2 \to \RR^3\) satisfying for each \(\alpha\),

1. \(S = \union_{\alpha} V_{\alpha}\) where \(V_{\alpha} = \varphi_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha}) = W_{\alpha} \cap S\), \(W_{\alpha} \subseteq \RR^3\) open,
2. \(\varphi_{\alpha}\) is a homeomorphism onto it's image \(V_{\alpha} = \varphi_{\alpha} (U_{\alpha})\)
3. \(d\varphi_{\alpha}|_x : \RR^2 \to \RR^3\) is injective for each \(x \in U_{\alpha}\).

** Remarks on the definition

Surfaces /look locally like \(\RR^2\)/.
- Items 1 and 2 say each point of \(S\) has a neighbourhood in a continuous one to one correspondence with an open set of the plane. 
- Here continuity is derived from continuity on \(\RR^3\):
  - Continuity of the map
    \[
    \varphi_{\alpha}^{-1} : V_{\alpha} \subseteq S \subseteq \RR^3 \to U_{\alpha} \subseteq \RR^2
    \]
    
    means for all convergent sequences \((x_n) \subseteq V_{\alpha}\), we have
    \[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} \varphi_{\alpha}^{-1} (x_n) = \varphi_{\alpha}^{-1} (\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n).
    \]
    
  - We say a subset \(V \subseteq S\) is open if and only if \(V = W \cap S\) for some open set \(W \subseteq \RR^3\). Thus each \(V_{\alpha} = W_{\alpha} \cap S\) is open. 
- Differentiability is not so easy.
  - Recall we need to make use of the /linear/ structure in order to define derivatives. 
  - But \(S\) need not be a linear subspace!

** Change of Parameters

The third condition implies that for each $\alpha,\beta$, the /change of parameters/
\[
\tau_{\alpha\beta} = \varphi_{\beta}^{-1} \circ \varphi_{\alpha} : \varphi_{\alpha}^{-1} (V_{\beta}) \subseteq \RR^2 \to \varphi_{\beta}^{-1} (V_{\alpha}) \subseteq \RR^2
\]
is a *diffeomorphism*.

That is, \(\tau_{\alpha\beta}\) is smooth with a smooth inverse. The inverse is in fact \(\tau_{\beta\alpha}\).



- We could replace condition 3 that \(d\varphi_{\alpha}\) is injective with the condition that \(\tau_{\alpha\beta}\) is smooth.

** Key Property of Change of Parameters

We have that \(\tau_{\alpha\beta}\) is a diffeomorphism.

*Fact*:
  \[
  \Phi_{\alpha\beta} : f \in C^{\infty}(\varphi_{\beta}^{-1} (V_{\alpha}), \RR) \mapsto f \circ \tau_{\alpha\beta} \in C^{\infty}(\varphi_{\alpha}^{-1} (V_{\beta}), \RR)
  \]
  is a bijection.



*** Calculus is diffeomorphism invariant!

Therefore, $\Phi_{\alpha\beta}$ establishes a one-to-one correspondence of smooth functions in one parametrisation with smooth functions in another parametrisation. 

A function \(f : \varphi_{\beta}^{-1} (V_{\alpha}) \to \RR\) is differentiable if and only if \(f \circ \tau_{\alpha\beta} : \varphi_{\alpha}^{-1} (V_{\beta}) \to \RR\) is differentiable.

* Tangent Plane                                                    :noexport:
** Tangent Vectors

#+BEGIN_env defn
A /tangent vector/ to \(\graph f\) at \(x \in \graph f\) is a vector \(X = \gamma'(0)\in \RR^3\) where \(\gamma(0) = x\).

The /tangent plane/, \(T_x \graph f\) to \(\graph f\) at \(x\) is the set of tangent vectors at \(x\).
#+END_env

Tangent vectors are velocity vectors to curves /along the graph/.

** Tangent plane

#+BEGIN_env lem
The tangent plane, \(T_x \graph f = dF_{(u, v)} (\RR^2)\) is a plane in \(\RR^3\) where \(F(u, v) = x\).
#+END_env


#+BEGIN_env pf
Let \((u, v) \in \RR^2\) be the unique point such that \(x = F(u, v)\). 

We have
\[
dF_{(u, v)} (\RR^2) = \{c^1 dF \cdot e_1 + c^2 dF \cdot e_2 = dF(c^1 e_1 + c^2 e_2) : c^1, c^2 \in \RR\}.
\]

and
\[
T_x \graph f = \{\gamma'(0) : \gamma(0) = x\}.
\]
#+END_env

** Tangent plane: \(df(\RR^2) \subseteq T_x \graph f\).

#+BEGIN_proof
\let\qed\relax
Since \(F : U \to \RR^3\) with \(U\) open, given any \(c^1, c^2\), there exists an \(\epsilon > 0\) such that
\[
\gamma(t) = (u, v) + t (c^1 e_1 + c^2 e_2) \in U, \quad t \in (-\epsilon, \epsilon).
\]


Then \(F \circ \gamma : (-\epsilon, \epsilon) \to \graph f\) satisfies \(F \circ \gamma(0) = x\) and
\[
X = (F \circ \gamma)'(0) = dF_{(u, v)} \cdot \gamma'(0) = dF_{(u, v)} \cdot (c^1 e_1 + c^2 e_2) \in T_x \graph f.
\]


Thus \(dF_{(u, v)} (\RR^2) \subseteq T_x \graph f\).
#+END_proof

** Tangent plane: \(T_x \graph f \subseteq df(\RR^2)\).

#+BEGIN_proof
Let \(X = \gamma'(0)\). 

Define
\[
\mu(t) = \pi \circ G^{-1} \circ \gamma(t)
\]
where \(\pi : (u, v, w) = (u, v)\) is orthogonal projection onto the \((u, v)\) plane. 

Recall that if \(\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) \in \graph f\), then
\[
G^{-1} (x(t), y(t), z(t)) = (u(t), v(t), 0).
\]
with \(F(u(t), v(t)) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))\).


Thus letting \(\mu'(0) = c^1 e_1 + c^2 e_2\) we have
\[
dF_{(u, v)} (c^1 e_1 + c^2 e_2) = (F \circ \mu)'(0) = (F \circ \pi \circ G^{-1} \circ \gamma)'(0) = \gamma'(0) = X.
\]


Thus \(T_x \graph f \subseteq dF_{(u, v)} (\RR^2)\).
#+END_proof

** Vector space structure on the tangent plane

We have two ways of realising the tangent plane as a vector space: 

1. \(T_x \graph f\) is a set of vectors in \(\RR^3\). So they inherit a vector space structure directly from \(\RR^3\)! 

   In terms of curves, let \(X_i = \gamma_i'(0)\) with \(\gamma_i(0) = x\) for \(i = 1, 2\). 
   
   Note that if \(\gamma_i(t) = (x_i(t), y_i(t), z_i(t))\) then \(\gamma_i'(0) = (x_i'(0), y_i'(0), z_i'(0))\). The vector space operations are then
   \[
   c^1 X_1 + c^2 X_2 = \mu'(0)
   \]
   where
   \[
   \mu(t) = x + c^1 (\gamma_1(t) - x) + c^2 (\gamma_2(t) - x)
   \]
   

   Then \(\mu'(0) = c^1 \gamma_1'(0) + c^2 \gamma_2'(t) = c^1 X_1 + c^2 X_2\). 

2. \(\RR^2\) is already a vector space and \(dF\) is injective since
   \[
   F_u = dF(e_1) = \partial_u F = e_1 + \partial_u f, \quad F_v = dF(e_2) = \partial_v F = e_2 + \partial_v f
   \]
   are linearly independent. Then \(c^1 X_1 + c^2 X_2 = dF(c^1 Y_1 + c^2 Y_2)\) where \(dF(Y_i) = X_i\) with \(Y_i\) uniquely determined.
** Vector space structure on the tangent plane

*Exercise*: Show that the map
\[
A : c^1 e_1 + c^2 e_2 \mapsto \partial_t|_{t=0} F((u, v) + t (c^1 e_1 + c^2 e_2))
\]
induces a linear isomorphism between \(dF_{(u, v)} (\RR^2)\) and \(T_x \graph f\).


Thus the two vector space structures are equivalent in the sense that they are isomorphic.

** Graphs

Graphs are regular surfaces.


- There is just one parametrisation:
   \[
   \varphi : (u, v) \mapsto (u, v, f(u, v))
   \]

- This map is a homeomorphism with inverse \(\varphi^{-1}(x, y, z) = (x, y)\) which is continuous since it is just the projection \(\RR^3 \to \RR^2\) onto the \(z = 0\) plane. 
- The differential is injective:
  \[
  d\varphi = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 \\
  \partial_u f & \partial_v f
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

** The Sphere

- The sphere is not a graph over any plane \(P \subseteq \RR^3\)
- Let \(N\) be the normal to \(P\). Then for any point \(p \in P\), the line \(p + t N\) either intersects in exactly 2 distinct points, 1 point (precisely for \(t = 0\)) or no points. Why? 
- Substitute: \(p + t N\) into \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\) and you get a quadratic in \(t\).
- Provided \(p + t N\) is not tangent to the sphere, the quadratic has either 0 roots or 2 roots.

** Parametrising the sphere

Let \(U = \{u^2 + v^2 < 1\}\) be the unit disc.  We do North, South, East, West.

- Northern hemisphere (over \(z = 0\) plane)
  \[
  \varphi_N (u,v) = \left(u, v, \sqrt{1 - (u^2 + v^2)}\right)
  \]

- Southern hemisphere (over \(z = 0\) plane)
  \[
  \varphi_S (u,v) = \left(u, v, -\sqrt{1 - (u^2 + v^2)}\right)
  \]

- Eastern hemisphere (over \(y = 0\) plane)
  \[
  \varphi_E (u, v) = \left(u, \sqrt{1 - (u^2 + v^2)}, v\right)
  \]

- Western hemisphere (over \(y = 0\) plane)
  \[
  \varphi_W (u, v) = \left(u, -\sqrt{1 - (u^2 + v^2)}, v\right)
  \]

** Polar Coordinates

Let \((\theta, \phi) \in (0, 2\pi) \times (0, \pi)\).

Define
\[
\varphi (\theta, \phi) = (\sin \phi \cos \theta, \sin \phi \sin \theta, \cos \phi)
\]


Then \(\varphi\) covers all of the sphere expect for the semi-circle \(\{x \geq 0\} \cap \{y = 0\} \cap \sphere^2\). 

We cover the entire sphere by also using the parametrisation
\[
\psi (\theta, \phi) = (\sin \phi \cos \theta, \cos\phi, \sin \phi \sin \theta)
\]

** The Torus
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width .4\textwidth :height .4\textheight
[[file:img/lec06_torus.png]]

- Rotate an \(xz\)-plane circle \((x, y, z) = (a \cos \theta + b, 0, a \sin \theta)\) with \(a < b\) around the \(z\)-axis. 
- The rotation is
  \[
  (x, z) \mapsto (x \cos \phi, x \sin \phi, z)
  \]

- Thus our parametrisation is
  \[
  (x, z) \mapsto (a \cos\phi \cos \theta + b \cos\phi, a \sin \phi \cos \theta + b \sin \phi, a \sin \theta).
  \]
