<p>We will start with the classical theory of curves and surfaces, but presented in a modern way that leads naturally and directly to the general theory of manifolds and Riemannian geometry. We will develop the formalism of manifolds, differential forms, vector bundles, Riemannian metrics and curvature, then apply these to global topics relating topology and curvature such as the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, classification of constant sectional curvature manifolds, and time permitting, some theorems in comparison geometry such as the Bonnet-Myers theorem.</p>
