<p>There are many texts on differential geometry with a variety of different perspectives. Some are quite classic, but certainly still useful and relevant. Some are quite abstract and others more down to earth. The ideal reference is one that works for you, and this will vary over time as you continue your studies so I suggest taking a look at several options (if possible) and going with whichever resonates most strongly with you. There are also links to online and freely available resources.</p>
