A smooth <i>parametrised curve</i> in \(\RR^n\) is a smooth function \(\gamma : (a, b) \to \RR^n\). In addition, \(\gamma\) is <i>regular</i> if \(\gamma'(t) \ne 0\) for all \(t \in (a, b)\).

<li>Regularity is <b>very</b> important. It allows us to transfer calculus on \((a, b)\) to calculus on \(\operatorname{Img} (\gamma) := \lbrace\gamma(t) : t \in (a, b)\rbrace \subseteq \RR^n\).</li>

Here are two different ways to parametrise the unit circle \(\lbrace x^2 + y^2 = 1 \rbrace\).

<p>
One thing to take away from this example, is that there are many ways to parametrise a curve. That is, defining
</p>

<p>
\[
\operatorname{Img}(\gamma) := \{\gamma(t) : a \leq t \leq b\}
\]
</p>

<p>
we have \(\operatorname{Img}(\gamma_1) = \operatorname{Img}(\gamma_2)\) but \(\gamma_1 \ne \gamma_2\). The paremetrisation \(\gamma_1\) is regular, but \(\gamma_2'(0) = 0\), hence \(\gamma_2\) is not regular.
</p>

<p>
There is thus a distiction between the parametrisation, \(\gamma\) and the image, \(\operatorname{Img}(\gamma)\).

<p>
In other words, \(C\) is a regular curve if there is at least one regular parametrisation of it. There will always be parametrisations that are not regular; for example, if \(\gamma\) is any parametrisation (regular or not), \(\sigma(s) = \gamma(a + (1/2)(s^3 + 1)(b-a))\) for \(s \in (-1, 1)\) is not regular since by the chain rule, \(\sigma'(0) = 0\).
</p>

<p>
It can be helpful to think of examples of sets \(C\) that are not regular curves. To begin with, \(C\) needs to be the image of a smooth map \((a, b) \to \RR^n\). But among such sets, there are examples of smooth, parametrised curves that are not regular.

<p>
The examples given so far are all with injective maps \(\gamma\). This need not be the case.
