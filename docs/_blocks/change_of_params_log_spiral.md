The logarmithmic spiral may be parametrised for $t \in (-\infty, \infty)$ as

$$
\gamma(t) = \left(e^{-t} \cos t, e^{-t} \sin t\right).
$$

Here is a change of parameters from $(0, 1)$ to $\RR$.

$$
\varphi(u) = \tan(\pi (u-1/2)), \quad u \in (0, 1),
$$

which is smooth. The inverse is smooth and is given by

$$
\varphi^{-1}(t) = \frac{1}{\pi} \arctan(t) + \tfrac{1}{2}.
$$

Thus $\varphi$ is a diffeomorphism from $(0, 1)$ to $\RR$, hence a change of parameters.
