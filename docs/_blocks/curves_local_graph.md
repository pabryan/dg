1. Using an argument similar to the previous theorem, show that any simple, regular curve is locally a graph. That is, for every $t \in (a, b)$, there is a $\delta > 0$ such that the image $\gamma(t_0-\delta, t_0+\delta)$ may be written as $(x, f(x))$ of $(g(y), y)$ with $f$ or $g$ smooth respectively.
2. Give an example of a regular curve that is not globally a graph.
