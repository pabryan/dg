Let $f : \SS^1 \to \RR^n$ be any function.

The function $f$ is continuous provided $f \circ q : \RR \to \RR^n$ is continuous.

The function $f$ is $C^k$ provided $f \circ q : \RR \to \RR^n$ is $C^k$. In particular, $f$ is smooth if $f \circ q$ is smooth - i.e. infinitely times differentiable.

We write $C^k(\SS \to \RR^n)$ for the set of $C^k$ functions $\SS \to \RR^n$, where $C^0$ denotes continuous functions, and $C^{\infty}$ denotes infinitely many times differentiable functions.

For $f \in C^k(\SS^1 \to \RR^n)$ and $0 \leq j \leq k$, the $j$-the derivative is defined to be
$$
f^{(j)}(\theta) = (f \circ q)^{(j)} (x)
$$
where $x \in q^{-1}(\theta)$; that is $q(x) = [x] = \theta$.
