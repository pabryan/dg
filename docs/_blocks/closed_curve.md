A closed curve is a set $C \subseteq \RR^n$ admitting a parametrisation $\gamma : [a, b] \to \RR^n$ such that

$$
\gamma^{(k)} (a) = \gamma^{(k)} (b)
$$

where $\gamma^{(k)}$ denotes the $k$-th derivative of $\gamma$, and $\gamma^{(0)} = \gamma$.

A closed curve is simple if in addition $\gamma$ is injective on $(a, b)$.
