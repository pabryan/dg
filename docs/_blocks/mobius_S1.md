Thinking of $\RR^2$ as $\CC$, the unit circle $\SS^1 = \lbrace\lvert z \rvert = 1\rbrace$, where $\lvert z \rvert = \sqrt{z\bar{z}}$ and $\bar{z}$ denotes the complex conjugate. For $A, B \in \CC$, any two complex numbers, with $\lvert A \rvert \neq \vert B \rvert$ define

$$
\varphi : \SS^1 \to \SS^1, \quad z \mapsto \frac{Az - B}{\bar{B}z - \bar{A}}.
$$

We call $\varphi$ a _Möbius transformation_.

1. Show that $\varphi$ is well defined. That is the denominator never vanishes and $\varphi$ does indeed map $\SS^1$ to $\SS^1$.
2. Show that $\varphi$ is a diffeomorphism by showing that $\varphi$ is smooth and has an inverse that is also a Möbius transformation, hence is also smooth.
