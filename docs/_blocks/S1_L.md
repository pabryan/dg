For $r > 0$, define

$$
\SS^1(r) = \RR/\sim
$$

where $x \sim y$ if and only if $x - y \in r \ZZ$. This is a model for the circle of radius $r$ and length $L = 2\pi r$. Thus $\SS^1 = \SS^1(1)$ with our definition of $\SS^1$.

Define maps $\varphi^r_{\pm} : (0, 2\pi r) \to \SS^1(r)$ analogously to $\SS^1$ and write down the corresponding definition of smooth functions to and from $\SS^1(r)$.

Exhibit a diffeomorphism $\SS^1(1) \to \SS^1(r)$ by giving an appropriate diffeomorphism $\RR \to \RR$ and show how this induces a diffeomorphism $\SS^1(1) \to \SS^1(r)$.

_Hint_: The map is the "obvious" one, but you should verify that it and it's inverse are smooth according to our definition via $\varphi_{\pm}^r$.
