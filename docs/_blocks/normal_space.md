Let $C$ be a regular curve. The _normal space_ at $p = \gamma(t_0)$ is the orthogonal complement of $T(t_0)$,

$$
N_p C = \lbrace V \in \RR^n : V \perp T(t_0) \rbrace
$$

For each $p \in C$, the normal space is a $(n-1)$-diemsional hyperplane through the point $p$ and we have the orthogonal decomposition, $\RR^n \sim T(p) \oplus N_p$.
