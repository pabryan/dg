Let $C$ be a regular curve and let $p_0 \in C$. Show that there are precisely two arc-length parametrisations with $\gamma_{\pm}(0) = p_0$ and that $\gamma_-'(0) = \gamma_+'(0)$.

_Hint_: To show existence let $\gamma$ be any regular parametrisation with $\gamma(t_0) = p_0$ and let $s= s_{t_0} (t)$. Reverse the direction of parametrisation to get the other arc length parametrisation. To show uniqueness consider the ODE and initial conditions satisfied by an arc length parametrisation with $s(0) = p_0$.
